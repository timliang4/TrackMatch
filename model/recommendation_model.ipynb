    "\n",
    "An undirected, edge-weighted graph is used to represent the relationships between tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A track is \"connected\" to another track in the graph if they have a playlist in common. These connections are weighted. For example, if a track and some other track share 20 playlists, their connection has a strong weight. On the other hand, if a track and some other track share only 1 playlist, their connection is weak. Thus, the relationships between all spotify tracks can be represented as a undirected, edge-weighted graph, where the tracks are nodes. The neighbors of a node with the strongest connections are therefore the songs that should be recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this makes sense. If you like a song and 20 other playlists have that song with another song, then that other song should be recommended.\n",

    "### Why RustworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python's built-in data structures would take significantly longer (hours) and take up much more memory. On the other hand, RustworkX uses Rust to populate the graph in less than a minute, using much less memory in the process."
